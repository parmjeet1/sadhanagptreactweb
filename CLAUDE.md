# Rules for Claude

## 1. Git and branches
- ONLY work on the branch `backup/all-work` in this repo. Never check out, create, change, commit to, or push to any other branch.
- NEVER push or commit to `main` (or `master`).
- Never force-push, and never rewrite history on a shared branch.
- Merging into other branches is done by the owner via pull request, never by Claude.
- Change log file for this repo: `CHANGELOG.md`.

## 2. Ask before anything risky
Stop and ask the owner for approval first (explain what and why in plain English) before:
- Deleting files or folders, renaming things, or changing the database structure.
- Changing secrets, `.env` files, API keys, payment settings, or Firebase/Vercel config.
- Installing or upgrading packages.
- Anything that could affect live users.

## 3. Database changes are done manually by the developer
- Claude never changes the database itself.
- If a database change is needed, share the exact SQL queries in the chat, with the reasoning for each (what it does, why it is needed, any risk).
- Then ask the developer to run them manually, and wait for confirmation before continuing.

## 4. Small steps, plain-English reports
- One task at a time, with a few small commits rather than one huge one.
- After each task, explain what changed in simple words, with no jargon.
- Say which files were touched and why.

## 5. Check before saying "done"
- Run the tests, build and linter where they exist, and report honestly if something fails.
- Never claim something works without having tested it.

## 6. Keep the change log updated
- Add a short entry to the change log for every change (create the file if it is missing).
- Every entry must have the developer name: **Manvatar Prabhu Ji**.
- Entry format: date, developer name, what changed (plain English), files touched.

## 7. Protect secrets and user data
- Never print, commit, or share keys, passwords, or student/user data.
- Never copy real data into logs or test files.

## 8. Backend and frontend stay in sync
- If an API changes on the backend, say what the frontend must change, and vice versa.
- The other repo is `parmjeet1/sadhanagptpunjabibagh`. Claude only edits this repo, and describes the needed changes for the other one.

## 9. Push only when the owner says so
- Commit locally, then ask "ready to push?" before every push.
- Push only to the working branch above, never anywhere else.
